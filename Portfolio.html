<p>Hello. My name is Nur Alya Binti Zahari and I am final year student Diploma in Information Management. I think positively and can execute on difficult tasks. I’m not an individual who needs to be micromanaged. Rather, when given a specific task, I can figure out the best ways to solve the problem in an autonomous manner.
	<p> Next, I helped my team to beat competing groups by encouraging everyone to speak up and contribute their ideas in meetings. I also supported those who were struggling to meet their commitments by offering to take on some of their tasks.
		<p>Lastly, I am someone who is consistently growing themselves and who takes the time to continue learning even though it’s not a direct requirement of the job. I find that many times it’s a combination of what we study both directly and indirectly related to work.
